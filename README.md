# GLSLX support for Visual Studio Code

This adds support for the [GLSLX shader language](https://github.com/evanw/glslx) to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Features include inline errors, type tooltips, go-to-definition, and symbol renaming. It's [open source](https://github.com/evanw/glslx-vscode) and is published as [glslx-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/evanw.glslx-vscode) on the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Installation

Installing extensions in Visual Studio Code is a little strange. Use Ctrl+P to bring up the in-app command line (Command+P on OS X), then type "ext install glslx-vscode" and press enter when it loads.
